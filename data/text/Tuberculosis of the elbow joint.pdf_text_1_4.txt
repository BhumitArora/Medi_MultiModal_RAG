the neutral zero method, there was limitation of motion 
as follows: flexion/extension of 130°/30°/0° and prona-
tion/supination of 70°/0°/70°.
Aside from the abovementioned findings, there were 
no other noticeable problems with the left upper extrem-

elevated total creatine kinase activity (4.86  µmol/s  L). 
Within the externally conducted X-ray of the elbow in 
two planes, a potential osteolysis of the olecranon was 
suspected (Fig. 1).
Therefore, further imaging with a computed tomogra-
