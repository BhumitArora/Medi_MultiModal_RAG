good clinical outcome based on the collected scores. 
Surgical treatment should be evaluated carefully and 
only be used as a last resort or when antibiotic therapy 
does not lead to a significant improvement [34]. This 
has already been described in the past by Martini et al. 
[35], in their publication from 1980, where acceptable

apy over 12 months.
In their recent review, Upadhyaya et al. conclude that

4–6 weeks of drug therapy, in the case of infected lesions
