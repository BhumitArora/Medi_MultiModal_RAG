accounting for 5–6% of all extrapulmonary TB (15–20%) 
[3]. The key to successful treatment lies in the earli-
est possible diagnosis, which can be achieved through a 
detailed anamnesis, an observant breakdown of medical 
history, extended imaging methods, and interdisciplinary 
collaboration.
Despite the slow growth of mycobacteria, the resisto-
gram should be awaited since extrapulmonary TB is often 
caused by multidrug-resistant mycobacteria stems [4–6]. 
Therefore, long-term antibiotic treatment using individu-
ally compiled drug combinations is obligatory. As shown 
in the underlying case, surgical treatment is not man-
datory for successful healing and rehabilitation of joint
