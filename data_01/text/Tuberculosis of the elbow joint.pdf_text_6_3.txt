and peripheral erosions in the area of the bone [27, 28]. 
However, these radiological changes can also be com-
pletely absent or occur in other diseases such as rheu-
matoid arthritis, therefore complicating the diagnostic 
process [29–32].
Bone and joint TB is mainly caused by the strain M. 
tuberculosis (> 90%). In a French retrospective analysis, 
M. bovis was also detected in 4.3% of patients, whereas 
a Chinese study failed to detect this strain even once [5, 
27].
In about one-tenth of cases, the TB pathogen is 
resistant to one of the four standard drugs (isoniazid, 
rifampicin, pyrazinamide, and ethambutol). Multidrug 
resistance (resistant to at least isoniazid and rifampicin)
