to clindamycin 600Â mg three times per day, according to 
the available resistogram of the detected staphylococcus 
epidermidis.
When the wound was dry and without irritation, the 
patient was discharged 2 days after the second-look sur-
gery, with immobilization. Wearing the cast until com-
pleted wound healing, with daily exercises to maintain 
mobility, was advised. The antibiotic therapy was recom-
mended to be continued for an additional 5 days. Fur-
thermore, we scheduled regular appointments with our 
infectious disease outpatient clinic. The results of the 
histopathological and microbiological examinations were 
still pending at this time.
