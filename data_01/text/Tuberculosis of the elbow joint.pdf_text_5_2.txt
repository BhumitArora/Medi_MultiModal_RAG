TB occur extrapulmonary. In these cases, usually lymph 
nodes, parenchymatic organs, and the spine are affected. 
Infections of other bones or peripheral joints, such as the 
elbow, joint are very rare, with an incidence of approxi-
mately 2–5% [4, 12, 14–16]. Although the incidence in 
risk areas, such as the country of origin of our patient, 
is high at 15–20%, it is comparatively low in the Western 
world [3, 17]. This is why current literature mainly con-
sists of case reports and a few reviews. Randomized stud-
ies evaluating the efficacy of a specific treatment or giving 
guidance regarding the diagnostic process are scarce, if 
not unavailable [7].
